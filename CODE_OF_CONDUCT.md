# Hacker ethics

* Access to computers – and anything which might teach you something about the way the world really works – should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust authority – promote decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their acting, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.
* Don't litter other people's data.
* Make public data available, protect private data.
